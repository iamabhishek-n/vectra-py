## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.8 or higher
- **pip** (usually installed with Python)
- **git**

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamabhishek-n/vectra-py.git
cd vectra-py
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

On Linux/macOS:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. **Install the package in development mode with test dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

5. **Verify your setup:**

```bash
pytest
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/issue-name
# or
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style of the project.

3. **Add or update tests** for any new functionality or bug fixes.

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages.

## Running Tests

We use **pytest** for testing. Run the test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

All new features and bug fixes should include corresponding test cases. Tests are essential for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.

## Linting

We use **ruff** for linting. Run it with:

```bash
ruff check .
```

CI currently lints against a narrow, high-signal rule set (pyflakes `F` +
pycodestyle errors `E`, with `E501` line-length ignored) rather than ruff's
full default rule set — see the `[tool.ruff]` section in `pyproject.toml`.
This scope may be widened over time as the codebase is brought into
compliance with additional rules.

## Making a Pull Request

1. **One logical change per PR** - Keep pull requests focused on a single feature, bug fix, or improvement.

2. **Update documentation** - If your change affects user-facing behavior, update the relevant documentation (README, examples, etc.).

3. **Reference related issues** - If your PR addresses an existing GitHub issue, include the issue number in your PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123").

4. **Ensure CI passes** - Your PR must pass all automated checks:
   - All tests must pass (`pytest`)
   - Lint must pass (`ruff check .`)

   (Maintainers: see [Branch Protection Setup](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md)
   for the one-time manual step that makes these checks required before merging.)

5. **Provide a clear PR description** - Explain what your change does, why it's needed, and how to test it.

6. **Be responsive to feedback** - We'll review your PR and may request changes or clarifications.

## Code of Conduct

Please review and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a feature request? Please use the appropriate issue template:

- **Bug Report:** [Submit a bug report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- **Feature Request:** [Submit a feature request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)

When reporting issues, include:
- A clear description of the problem or request
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Your environment (Python version, OS, vectra-py version)
- Any relevant code snippets or error messages

## Versioning and Changelog Discipline

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Version
bumps and `CHANGELOG.md` updates should happen in their own commit/PR,
separate from feature/fix commits.

This matters in practice: this repository's own history has several
same-day version bumps landing as their own isolated commits alongside unrelated CI and feature
work committed the same day, and at least one version bump was folded into a feature commit rather than split out. That made it
significantly harder to reconstruct an accurate `CHANGELOG.md` after the
fact, since a version bump on its own commit gives no indication of what it
actually shipped. Keeping version bumps isolated, and pairing them with a
`CHANGELOG.md` entry in the same commit/PR, avoids repeating that problem.
