# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in vectra-py (published as `vectra-rag-py`), please report it privately rather than opening a public GitHub issue.

Email: astroabhi.abhi@gmail.com

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (a minimal example is ideal)
- The version of `vectra-rag-py` affected

We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days. Once a fix is available, we'll coordinate on a disclosure timeline with you before making details public.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published version on PyPI receives security fixes.

## Scope

This SDK orchestrates calls to external vector databases and LLM providers that you configure and supply credentials for — it does not host or store your data itself. Vulnerabilities in this repo's own code (e.g. SQL/expression construction, input validation, dependency issues) are in scope. Misconfiguration of the external services you connect it to is not.
